The Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is a fundamental tool in project management, serving as a hierarchical decomposition of the total scope of work required to complete a project and achieve its objectives. It visually breaks down complex projects into smaller, more manageable components, making it easier to plan, execute, and control the project lifecycle.

A SWOT Analysis is a strategic planning technique used to identify and analyze the **S**trengths, **W**eaknesses, **O**pportunities, and **T**hreats related to a business, project, or even an individual. It's a simple yet powerful framework for understanding the internal and external factors that can impact success.

Here's a breakdown of each component:

- **Strengths (Internal, Helpful):** These are the internal positive attributes and resources that give an entity a competitive edge or contribute to its success. They are things that the entity does well or possesses that are advantageous. Examples include a strong brand reputation, skilled workforce, efficient processes, or proprietary technology.
    
- **Weaknesses (Internal, Harmful):** These are the internal negative factors or limitations that can hinder performance or put the entity at a disadvantage. They are areas where the entity is lacking or underperforms. Examples include a weak marketing strategy, outdated technology, lack of resources, or poor internal communication.
    
- **Opportunities (External, Helpful):** These are external factors or conditions that could be favorable to the entity and that it could potentially leverage for growth or improvement. They exist in the external environment and are not currently controlled by the entity. Examples include emerging markets, new technologies, favorable regulatory changes, or a competitor's.
    
- **Threats (External, Harmful):** These are external factors or conditions that could potentially harm the entity's performance or success. They are challenges or obstacles that exist in the external environment. Examples include economic downturns, increased competition, changing customer preferences, or unfavorable government policies.

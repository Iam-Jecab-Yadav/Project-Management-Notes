The Waterfall methodology is a traditional project management approach characterized by a linear, sequential flow. In this model, each phase of the project must be completed and signed off before the next phase can begin, much like how water flows down a waterfall. It's a rigid and structured approach that emphasizes detailed planning and documentation upfront.

This methodology originated in the manufacturing and construction industries and was later adapted for software development. It follows a distinct set of phases that are completed in a strict order.

**Key Phases of the Waterfall Methodology:**

While the specific names and number of phases can vary slightly, the typical phases of the Waterfall model include:

1. **Requirements Gathering and Analysis:** This initial phase focuses on understanding and documenting all the requirements of the project in detail. This involves extensive communication with stakeholders to capture their needs and expectations. A comprehensive requirements document is the key deliverable of this phase.
2. **System Design:** Based on the finalized requirements, the system architecture and design are created. This includes defining the overall structure, user interfaces, databases, and other technical specifications. This phase results in a design document that serves as a blueprint for the next stage.
3. **Implementation (Coding):** In this phase, the actual development or coding takes place based on the design specifications. The system is built according to the documented requirements and design.
4. **Testing (Verification):** Once the implementation is complete, the system is rigorously tested to identify any defects or issues. This phase ensures that the developed product meets the requirements defined in the initial stage. Various levels of testing, such as unit testing, integration testing, and system testing, are performed.
5. **Deployment (Delivery):** After successful testing, the product is deployed to the production environment or delivered to the customer.
6. **Maintenance:** This ongoing phase involves providing support for the product, fixing bugs, and implementing updates or enhancements based on user feedback or changing requirements.

**When is Waterfall Best Suited?**

The Waterfall methodology is most suitable for projects with:

- **Well-defined and stable requirements:** When the project scope and requirements are clear, well-understood, and unlikely to change during the project lifecycle.
- **Predictable projects:** Projects with a clear understanding of the technology, tools, and processes involved.
- **Projects with a strong emphasis on documentation:** The Waterfall model generates extensive documentation at each stage, which can be beneficial for knowledge transfer and long-term maintenance.
- **Projects where quality assurance is critical from the outset:** The sequential nature allows for thorough review and sign-off at each phase.

**Advantages of the Waterfall Methodology:**

- **Clear structure and easy to understand:** The linear nature makes it simple to follow and manage.
- **Emphasis on detailed documentation:** This provides a clear record of the project and facilitates knowledge transfer.
- **Disciplined approach:** The strict phase transitions and sign-offs ensure a structured and controlled process.
- **Easy to track progress:** Progress can be easily measured against the completion of each phase.
- **Suitable for projects with stable requirements:** Works well when the scope is fixed and unlikely to change.

**Disadvantages of the Waterfall Methodology:**

- **Lack of flexibility:** It is difficult and costly to incorporate changes once a phase is completed.
- **Late identification of issues:** Problems or misunderstandings in requirements or design may only be discovered late in the process during testing, making them expensive to fix.
- **Limited client involvement:** Client interaction is typically limited to the initial requirements phase and the final acceptance.
- **No working product until late in the lifecycle:** Stakeholders cannot see a working version of the product until the implementation and testing phases are complete.
- **Higher risk for complex or uncertain projects:** The rigid nature is not well-suited for projects with evolving requirements or those involving new or rapidly changing technologies.

In conclusion, the Waterfall methodology provides a structured and disciplined approach to project management, best suited for projects with clearly defined and stable requirements. However, its lack of flexibility and late identification of issues can be significant drawbacks in dynamic or complex environments.

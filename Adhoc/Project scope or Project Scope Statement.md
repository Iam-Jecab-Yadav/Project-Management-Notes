**Key Components of Project Scope:**

- **Project Objectives:** The overarching goals the project aims to achieve. What is the desired outcome or impact of the project?
- **Deliverables:** The tangible or intangible outputs, results, or products that will be produced by the project. These should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) whenever possible.
- **Requirements:** The conditions or capabilities that the deliverables must meet to satisfy the project's objectives and stakeholder needs. These can be functional (what the product/service does) or non-functional (quality, performance, usability, etc.).
- **Tasks and Activities:** The specific work steps and actions that the project team will undertake to produce the deliverables. A Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is often used to break down the project into smaller, manageable tasks.
- **Exclusions:** Clearly stating what is _not_ included in the project is as vital as defining what is. This helps manage expectations and prevents assumptions that can lead to scope creep.
- **Constraints:** Any limitations or restrictions that may impact the project, such as budget, timeline, resources, technology, or regulatory requirements.
- **Assumptions:** Factors that are considered to be true and reliable for project planning, but may require validation.

Scrum is a lightweight, agile framework designed to help individuals, teams, and organizations generate value through adaptive solutions for complex problems.

At its core, Scrum is based on empiricism and lean thinking. Empiricism asserts that knowledge comes from experience and making decisions based on what is observed, while lean thinking aims to reduce waste and focus on the essentials. Scrum employs an iterative, incremental approach to optimize predictability and control risk, particularly in product development.

The structure of Scrum is intentionally minimalist, relying on a small, self-managing, and cross-functional team known as the **Scrum Team**. This team consists of three specific accountabilities:

- **The Product Owner:** Accountable for maximizing the value of the product resulting from the work of the Scrum Team. They manage the Product Backlog, which is an ordered list of everything that might be needed in the product.
- **The Scrum Master:** Accountable for establishing Scrum as defined in the Scrum Guide. They help everyone understand Scrum theory and practice, both within the Scrum Team and the organization. The Scrum Master is a servant-leader to the Scrum Team.
- **The Developers:** Accountable for creating a usable Increment in a Sprint. They are the people in the Scrum Team who are committed to creating any aspect of a usable Increment each Sprint.

Scrum prescribes a series of events, each serving a specific purpose and acting as a formal opportunity for inspection and adaptation:

- **The Sprint:** A fixed-length timebox of one month or less, during which a "Done," useable, and potentially releasable Increment is created. Sprints are the heartbeat of Scrum, occurring consecutively without gaps.
- **Sprint Planning:** An event that kicks off the Sprint, where the Scrum Team collaborates to define the Sprint Goal and select the Product Backlog items they will work on during the Sprint, creating the Sprint Backlog.
- **Daily Scrum:** A short, daily event for the Developers to inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal and adapt the Sprint Backlog as needed, adjusting the upcoming planned work.
- **Sprint Review:** Held at the end of the Sprint to inspect the Increment and adapt the Product Backlog if needed. The Scrum Team presents the results of their work to key stakeholders and progress toward the Product Goal is discussed.
- **Sprint Retrospective:** Occurs after the Sprint Review and before the next Sprint Planning. The Scrum Team inspects itself and creates a plan for improvements to be enacted during the next Sprint.

Scrum utilizes artifacts to represent work and value, providing transparency and opportunities for inspection and adaptation:

- **Product Backlog:** A dynamic, ordered list of everything that is known to be needed in the product. It is the single source of truth for all work to be done. The commitment for the Product Backlog is the **Product Goal**, which is the future state of the product that the Scrum Team plans to achieve.
- **Sprint Backlog:** Composed of the Sprint Goal, the set of Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint, and the plan for delivering the Increment. The commitment for the Sprint Backlog is the **Sprint Goal**, the single objective for the Sprint.
- **Increment:** A concrete stepping stone toward the Product Goal. Each Increment is an addition of value and is useable. The commitment for the Increment is the **Definition of Done**, a formal description of the state of the Increment when it meets the quality measures required for the product.

Scrum's effectiveness relies on its five values: Commitment, Focus, Openness, Respect, and Courage. These values provide a foundation for the Scrum Team's work, interactions, and decisions. By embracing these values and adhering to the framework's structure of roles, events, and artifacts, Scrum teams can navigate complexity, deliver value incrementally, and continuously improve their process and product.
